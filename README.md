# snappin

Experimental chrome extension for posting a snapshot to pinterest, heavily inspired by [ShotPin](http://shotpin.com/).

## Why that?

Shotpin is great, but it does not work anymore (currently). And as I do not know about the licence of the shotpin code, I tried to achieve some similar functionality with my own code.

## What about ShotPin?

I do not know. The only sign of life, was on the youtube channel some time ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-2P7iYKjZA
